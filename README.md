# DeepLearning
In the project, I tackled two tasks: 1) Developed a neural network to predict future values from 10-second interval time sequences. 2) Identified "OFF Periods" in Parkinson's patients using the network on healthy patient data. Both tasks showcased neural networks' potential in prediction and medicine.
